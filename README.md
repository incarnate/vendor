# Vendor - A VR Payment Demo

Built for the 2016 eWAY Dev Hackathon, this demo provides a simple proof of concept of purchasing and payment in Virtual Reality.

Some clean up and enhancements made before publishing.


## Viewing

Using a VR Viewer such as Google Cardboard is the best way to experience Vendor. Alternatively, a browser works fine.

Open up the [Vendor site](https://vendor.incarnated.net) in your device, and enter any email & password to get past the login screen (these details aren't sent or stored anyway).
In a real store, this would log you into your account which already has your card and address details.

If you are using Cardboard, rotate the phone to landscape and touch the Cardboard logo in the lower right.

To navigate, simply look around (click and drag in the browser). To select something, look at it for 3 seconds (just click in the browser).


## Technology

Vendor is built using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), a web framework for building VR pages. It also uses the following components:

 * [aframe-event-set-component](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-event-set-component)
 * [aframe-layout-component](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-layout-component)
 * [aframe-template-component](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-template-component)
 * [aframe-bmfont-text-component](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-bmfont-text-component)
